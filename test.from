Swearinger *and* Lewis. Let's not forget him stumbling after T.Y. in the endzone. I'm actually kinda surprised on how much we agree on based on these past few days. Had no idea you thought Lockett was a good receiver.
I was simultaneously elated, but distracted, at how obvious the cleavage was for both Widow and Witch. They weren't even trying to be subtle. 
Not at all. Why would you put those words in my mouth? It would be ignorant to say that all of these protests/riots are happening because of an accidental death of a career criminal... they are doing it because they are being told he was murdered.
If you have them run over the glowy fire thingies they take extra damage and move slower.
Would that make it a 'Rowdeo'?

Right? Awesome grab for the steelers. 
Really? People don't feel the need to do damage control on their reputations after they get negative press? That doesn't really align with my experience.

When did you apply, the past 2 years' GPA cutoffs have been posted and none of them required a 4.0 (Only like Architectural for the technical GPA), and from my understanding the process is pretty much automatic based on GPA. 
There's no such thing as a closed-source API...any API available to an Android application can be reimplemented by Microsoft, assuming they know what it does...which is a safe assumption, because it wouldn't be used otherwise.
Except they were all Tony lines.
Helps with coordination and to a smaller extent morale. Same reason they do it on the Su-34. See the Mi-28 for a more conventional layout.

If you're trying to discourage a few players, just put then in a pod together... 
Players need to learn the unwritten rules of twitter.
Not a bad suggestion, but they have to switch between sheets fairly regularly (financial stuff, among other things), so two (or more, up to six) separate windows really is better for them.
It's probably on YouTube I'd imagine. ;)

Then hit cruise control on his Hyundai.
He would have taken it years ago if not for injuries. What has been most impressive is how under control he has been. Hitting, defense, baserunning...he's just very under control and not erratic.
