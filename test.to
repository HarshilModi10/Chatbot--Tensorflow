I'd take Flowers over Peat.  He's drafted to be a RT initially and he is a physical mauler right now.  Beatty isn't a bad LT.  Stick him at RT, kick Pugh down RG, and all the sudden the O-line looks not half bad when Shwartz is healthy

two forces that sometimes are enough on their own, sometimes work together: 1. Colleges don't like failing people. It can wreck their GPA, which makes them less hire-able (sometimes) or, worse, it can make them take longer to graduate. So oftentimes it's difficult to fail. 2. Professors like rewarding effort. So if someone works REALLY hard, does a TON of extra credit work, sees you in your office hours, etc etc, the professor is more likely to pass them.

He ran as an independent in both his House and Senate campaigns, but to be a presidential candidate he does not have that option.  You can't get ballot access in enough states to win unless you get the nomination of a party that has that ballot access.*  The only other parties that have enough states to win are the Republicans and the Libertarians.  There is also the issue of getting into debates.  Third parties are effectively blacked out because they need to reach a threshold (12% if memory serves) of support in the polls.  While I think it is probably an obtainable number for him most of the polls only list the donkeys and elephants so he wouldn't be able to rank in them at all.newLineCharnewLineCharnewLineChar*It's not literally impossible to get ballot access as an independent it's just completely unrealistic.newLineChar

It's not uneducated to have a different opinion. I personally can't imagine why anyone would ever want to live in a desert, I prefer to live somewhere that gets a moderate amount of rain and has plenty of vegetation, where wildfires aren't a huge risk, and i can have a garden and grow food for myself without jumping through hoops to either source water to sustain it or pick the crops carefully so they can survive.

It depends on the severity/level of supports needed. Our kids usually have an IEP or a 504 plan. However, not all of our ADHD kids have an IEP/504.

I am not religious at all but the beast the christians worry about so much does seem to be a real thing. I tried to cash a USPS money order today at the USPS.

A double room means you will share a bedroom with your assigned roommate and a common suite area with your roommate and two other people who have the adjacent bedroom. If you look back to the pictures on the website, you'll notice there are two beds in each bedroom.

So you have three hours to set up the transplant operation, and get the buyer to proffer payment for the illicit organ, and get yourself out of there so the buyer wouldn't be able to get his money back, and somehow do all of this without the people on the black market finding out that someone out there is selling disappearing organs, so that you can do it over and over again until you were rich?

Sure thing. You could always get a job in a factory and see how much lateral movement (at best) that affords you... Law isn't what it used to be, no one is saying that it is, but it *does* have versatility. You can say it doesn't and read US News reports about this and that but the fact remains that it's a job with incredible freedom. If you can't get a job - you can work for yourself. If you don't like the type of law you're doing, you can do another. If you don't like law at all, you can do something nonlegal. Will it necessarily be super lucrative? No. But what realistic guarantees are there in life ever? We're not doctors - we don't make a killing just for going to school for a long time. Forge your own path.

At that time, players had jetpacks to move around the map, but had to run or use a vehicle to travel long distances. Many of the maps were large even compared to those in* Tribes: Ascend*, leading to fairly slow attacks on enemy bases. Early on, the players learned that if you spam the jump button while on the side of a steep hill, the game's physics would propel you down the hill and allow you to fly extremely fast across the map.

My understanding (from some googling I did many, many months ago) is that there was an issue with iOS where 2x, 2.5x and 3x all played at double speed due to some sort of limitation. And so they decided that rather than change hte titles they would keep 3x as the top speed, being double speed, and then scale back the other ones. Although it was an iOS issue it appears that they keep the speed matched across iOS and Android (I recently made the swap, so have experience with both)newLineCharnewLineCharI have noticed that on iOS the downpur app plays 3x at triple speed, so maybe hte iOS issue is gone but Audible has stuck with their system as everyone is used to it.newLineCharnewLineChar1x is definintely not slowed down. If you play it and time it 1 minutes of audio takes 1 minute of playback. Do you normally go with 1.5x speed? If so, then it will become normalised to you and anything else feels slow.

It's actually a relevant distinction. Social democrats are capitalists. Socialists are anti-capitalist. For leftists, economic systems are central to *everything*. That's the huge thing about Marxism, it recognises the decoupling of history from the economic circumstances of the people living it (and instead postulating great people and great events) as false. *Within* various leftist communities, the Monty Python quote is apt.

It feels good to cut down those who hurt us, but the backlash can be very awful and be ten times as dangerous as the original sting. People can be very passionate about matters like this, and I would never dare to endanger my career, property, or personal safety just to get the last word.newLineCharnewLineCharIt is far more healthy and productive to have a support network or community where you can vent, receive helpful advice, and be reminded of ways to protect yourself against those with nothing better to do than destroy those who disagree with them.

Yes maintenance is done on regal intervals based on normal parts wear. But if something goes wrong it may not be caught till much later.newLineCharnewLineCharTake for instance your oil change. Every 3k for regular and 7k for synthetic. Now the majority of the time it works great and allows for a regular inspection of the car. But say now something goes wrong like a leak and you don't check your oil before every drive. Your engine seizes and becomes slag. newLineCharnewLineCharDue to the size of the pipeline the use maintance schedules since it cannot be 100% inspected every day. Lucky when that interval came up they found it before it started to leak.newLineCharnewLineChar

Its called the [ASROC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUM-139_VL-ASROC). newLineCharnewLineCharBasically its a missile with a torpedo on top. The idea is if you detect a submarine outside the range of your ship-launched torpedoes (forgot to include above, will fix), you fire off one of these to kill it. Alternatively, you could use the same torpedoes on helicopters, but the older ships can't operate helicopters for extended periods (no hangar).

I'm reading a paper that the guest wrote on neoliberalism in black communities. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10999949.2012.763682newLineCharnewLineCharI think it explains his understanding of what neoliberalism is and how it is problematic.newLineChar'Finally, while I have focused on populations, we can lash these examples up to similar modes used to discipline, manage, and punish institutions and spaces. Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore—all represented by black mayors by the way—are all disciplined by bond rating agencies and by experts, who make life and death funding decisions based on their ability to govern themselves according to technologies of subjectivity. Finally, we can easily imagine a family governed by all three sets of techniques—an HIV+father who attends a prosperity gospel church along with his school-aged son not only attempts to use these techniques to make healthy choices (to develop a rigorous HIV testing regiment for example), but attends a local church using the pastor's sermons to get his financial house in order, while his son competes with other kids for cash prizes. Caught in overlapping frameworks of governance, this father and child can potentially understand their lives as being determined by political circumstances they are not responsible for. But it is far more likely they will fault themselves (and each other) for their condition. And as these modes of government play an increasing role in our lives, it is far more likely we will as well.'

I still dream about Cassel's back being healthy.  It was a good, closer WCF between the Lakers and Wolves without him, and he was a huge part of the team's success that year.newLineCharnewLineCharEven with the injury, he gutted through 64 minutes and scored 37 points in 4 games.  Poor Darrick Martin had to start and play big minutes in his place, and he was just overwhelmed.  Shot 29% from the series.newLineCharnewLineCharThe 4 Laker wins were by 11, 9, 7, and 6 points.  If Cassel's healthy, that series goes 7, with Game 7 at the Target Center.  Would've been an all-timer, and a real chance for Prime Kevin Garnet to be nationally showcased.newLineCharnewLineCharShaq was a dominator, Duncan was greatness you could set your watch by, but Prime KG was a basketball force.  He affected every facet of the game at 7'1'.  Makes me sad that people's image of him seems to be during his Celtic years.

I DO think it would be cool if they found a way to work in that comparison subtly, but I dunno if I want him to go THAT dark. One of my favorite things about the MCU is the long game they've been playing, with Tony slowly changing into the man who can fit the mold of the Tony from Civil War. But if he's the clear cut bad guy of the movie, that will be a massive failure. I want him to get darker, sure, and I think he has, but I also want to understand why he does the things that he does and to find his reasoning at least a little convincing. newLineCharnewLineCharCivil War won't work if I don't believe both sides. Of course, we don't know what shape the conflict is going to take, either, or even how big the hero vs. hero aspect of it's going to be. We obviously don't know much of anything concrete about that movie, so speculation at this point's kinda baseless. I just really really like what they've done with Tony in Phase 2, and I wanna see them stick the landing.

If you were to look at it as a simple equation of price divided by number of pieces, then yes. However for match rounds, I keep my lots separated through the life of the brass. Since Nosler brass comes in packs of 50, I have 10 five round groups per box. It would cost me $1.20 to use one of my pieces, however that would leave me with 9 five round groups and 1 four round groups. It is worth more than $1.20 to not do that.

you always want to be fast. the point of dash-dancing is to weave in and out of your opponents range, bait out attack, or maybe even catch them off gaurd with one. if the dash dance is super short then you can easily get hit and its easy to predict your movements. oh and you should learn to down tilt or forward smash out of your run animation which is another option of approaching, note that you cant do this out of a dash, you have to be running and then hold down and do either after that

I guess I don't *necessarily* disagree, but it would require a significant modification in social norms that are prevalent across most human cultures... I'm pretty sure in most of the world being completely nude is generally frowned upon in public places.newLineCharnewLineCharI do believe that breasts (for example) can be desexualized as there are many cultures that do not do so, but nakedness itself is seen near universally as a very personal thing, something that you would only express to another who you deeply cared for romantically. At the same time, sexuality is also driven by basic physical urges which I feel creates a situation incompatible with the intellectual notion of decoupling sex and nudity.

That's a good question. It's not a big deal to me in that my sex drive isn't strong enough to make me seek out no-strings-attached sex, but sex with someone I'm in an intimate relationship with is definitely appealing and something I'd 'seek out', so to speak.

Headaches are relieved by constricting blood vessels and reducing pressure. Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor. Not sure why I get down voted for stating a medical fact. Caffeine works by attaching itself to adenosine, constricting blood vessels, and increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the brain. Alcohol, on the other hand, is a vasodilator, you'll notice flushing and redness, as well as headaches, often result from alcohol consumption.

Sure. newLineCharnewLineCharThe pro legalization people make some sound arguments, but they discount a lot of things as well. newLineCharnewLineChar- marijuana is a price sensitive drug for young people, basic rule of supply and demand (and some other factors) says that more supply = lower price. By keeping the price high, less kids will have money to buy it. To give an extreme example, if 1 gram of marijuana cost $500,000 no kid would ever smoke weed again. newLineCharnewLineChar- community standards, a lot of people don't want marijuana legalized they don't want to be around it. Let's be honest about marijuana it stinks! It has a more powerful smell than cigarettes. Sure there are edibles (I'll get to those later!) but you can be smoking weed in the house next door and I can smell it. newLineCharnewLineChar- edibles are just dangerous. There is no labelling, one could easily give one to a child by accident (which has happened many times and increased instances in Colorado since legalization) leading to hospital visits. One could eat a brownie not knowing it has reefer and go and drive.newLineCharnewLineChar- long term, I am not sure if there is money to be made.

Maybe, but I don't think it is that short. Mason looked good against bad teams and good teams crushed him. I know the Rams had offensive line struggles, but clearly they think Gurley is a beast.  I didn't expect this pick, but I get it. I don't think the leash is short, he would have to play really bad for him to lose significant playing time. I feel like Rams fans over inflate our RB talent. Stacy carried too much extra weight, Cunningham is a 3rd down pass catcher, and Mason, who I like, might not be able to be as physical for a long period of time. newLineCharnewLineCharThe 2 linemen they wanted were off the board, Parker didn't make sense, there was no defensive linemen that were highly regarded and Waynes would be dumb. The Rams could maybe use a safety/corner, but Waynes to me will not be that much of an upgrade. They took best player available and if he stays healthy he should be good with the Rams. newLineCharnewLineCharBoom or bust pick to me. At #10 I expect a great RB or just another RB that we don't need.

I'm not going to dispense relationship advice as any asshole can give advice; I prefer to give experiences. newLineCharnewLineCharMy ex is Russian and saw a lot of tragic shit over there to the point she was numb, like me from being overseas, to pretty much anything other than child &amp; animal abuse. She moved to MN in 2001 and I figured she was immune to damn near everything as wekkand then she saw a car accident up near Fargo where a woman died. I briefly asked about it and she shrugged it off like it was nothing; so naturally I left it there. Weeks later she started having nightmares about it because it kicked into high gear a ton of things she had repressed when she left Russia. So in my experience you don't need to constantly bombard her about it as she is likely in shock right now, but ask her before the night is over if she wants to talk about it or if she would like you be there for her.newLineCharnewLineCharIts the right thing and she will appreciate it no matter what you might think right now and its a genuinely caring thing to do for her.newLineCharnewLineCharAgain, best thoughts to the both of you and let me know if I can help at all as I have a lot of experience, personally and professionally (I worked in the field).newLineCharnewLineCharIf you need a get away this weekend I am hosting a MN meet up for /r/cigars and /r/centuryclub - feel free to reach out and pop over.newLineCharnewLineCharhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/33fcks/the_bums_first_2015_mn_rcigars_herf_a_celebration/

I should clarify that it's not my opinion.newLineCharnewLineCharThe link I provided does mention it why some people believe it though:newLineCharnewLineChar&gt; Those who oppose the drinking of alcohol, in any quantity, argue that Jesus would not have turned the water into wine, as He would have been promoting the consumption of a substance that is tainted by sin. In this understanding, alcohol itself is inherently sinful, and consumption of alcohol in any quantity is sin. That is not a biblical understanding, however. Some Scriptures discuss alcohol in positive terms. Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing. Isaiah 55:1 encourages, “Yes, come buy wine and milk…” From these and other Scriptures, it is clear that alcohol itself is not inherently sinful. Rather, it is the abuse of alcohol, drunkenness and/or addiction, that is sinful (Ephesians 5:18; Proverbs 23:29-35; 1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19). Therefore, it would not have been a sin for Jesus to create a drink that contained alcohol.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt; A second, related argument is that by creating alcoholic wine, Jesus would have been promoting drunkenness, which the Bible clearly identifies as sinful. This is not a valid argument. Was Jesus promoting gluttony when He multiplied the fishes and loaves far beyond what the people needed? Of course not. Creating a substance that can be abused does not make one responsible when another person foolishly chooses to abuse it. Jesus creating alcoholic wine was in no sense encouraging drunkenness.newLineChar

Bernie [on TPP](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file):newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largestnewLineCharmulti-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations ofnewLineCharAmerican democracy.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;It is part of a global race to the bottom tonewLineCharboost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights;newLineChardismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challengenewLineCharour laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.newLineCharnewLineCharTo see how TPP is actually beneficial, look at what MIT labor economist Autor said in the article I posted e.g.:newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;There are several reasons to support the TPP despite globalization concerns. First, the TPP — which seeks to govern exchange of not only traditional goods and services, but also intellectual property and foreign investment — would promote trade in knowledge-intensive services in which U.S. companies exert a strong comparative advantage. Second, killing the TPP would do little to bring factory work back to America. Third, and perhaps most important, although China is not part of the TPP, enacting the agreement would raise regulatory rules and standards for several of China’s key trading partners. That would pressure China to meet some of those standards and cease its attempts to game global trade to impede foreign multinational companies.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;Most notably, it promises to liberalize trade in services and in agriculture, sectors in which the United States runs large trade surpluses, but which the World Trade Organization, despite 20 years of trying, has failed to pry open internationally. Successfully exporting information and computer services, where the U.S. maintains substantial technological leadership, requires more than low tariffs. It also requires protecting patents against infringement and safeguarding business assets and revenues against expropriation by foreign governments. newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;If passed, the TPP also would create a powerful template for future trade deals, including with China, which would move the U.S. closer to resolving conflicts the WTO has been unable to handle. Consider, for example, the case of Qualcomm, a highly successful San Diego-based maker of chipsets for wireless communications that earns half of its global revenues in China. The company’s substantial share of the Chinese chip market attracted the attention of the Chinese government, which proceeded to extract $1 billion in fines for alleged anti-competitive practices. In the U.S., where Qualcomm also sells its chipsets, the company has faced no such anti-trust penalties.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;Under current trade law, Qualcomm has little recourse to appeal its treatment by the Chinese government. Under a trade agreement with China like the TPP, however, Qualcomm and other U.S. companies would have access to an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.newLineCharnewLineCharHere Bernie talks to former Fed Chair Bernanke [about Fed lending](https://youtu.be/oOpQkRsEfaU?t=1m37s). As Bernanke said, they were only legally allowed to lend directly to depository institutions. Bernie also wanted to know why the Fed was not disclosing who they were lending to. There were two reasons, one that Bernanke brought up - institutions were reluctant to go to the Fed because it looks bad to debt markets (like they're insolvent). And what he didn't say is that the Fed was worried about triggering money market runs (if the lenders thought those institutions were insolvent). newLineCharnewLineCharIn [Ten Fair Ways to Reduce the Deficit and Create Jobs](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top10), Bernie lists currency manipulation by China and others as something which tackling would be beneficial. With TPP and other trade deals being discussed, currency manipulation was brought back on the table [by Bernie and others](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Stop-Currency-Manipulation-New-Battle-Cry-Democrats).newLineCharnewLineCharAs I said, no real proof is available to support that China has been manipulating exchange rates because of how the currencies are moving in forex markets. I can't think of major currency manipulators right now. But I'd curious how Bernie planned on differentiating between all types of currency intervention, like soft pegs and managed floats, from currency manipulation.

I think Prisoner of Azkaban will age the best. It's different than the rest of the series in the way it's directed and in a lot of ways it best represents the world of Harry Potter, with the effects and the magic. Cuaron had a lot to with that in his direction and the score is probably my favorite of the series as well. It's also Michael Gambon's first turn as Dumbledore and it's a bit more subtle, and the first movie with Lupin and Sirius Black. Azkaban is by far my favorite of the series.

Female rangers are quite stylish indeed, but do keep in mind that we are missing a large amount of features when compared to this video since we are several patches behind. Currently the female ranger has a rather confusing system (others might find it not as confusing but it is weird for me) where a class defining chain blade buff stops you from using some of your shooting skills and restricts you to only using modified kicks, which are pretty cool and are definitely viable but having half your skills locked away from you might be kinda weird. In the future her twin chainblades ability gets worked into a passive into her kit which allows her to use all her skills. I would wait until then.

As subreddit moderators we cannot see anyone's IP addresses or set IP address bans - we can only set bans based on usernames (or set up AutoModerator filters to auto-remove comments based on patterns).

Haaah! I was adopted, sister and I were used to care for house like free servants, parents collected paycheck from state and treated her and I like crap, while spending money on their own two kids. It was a giant vat of shit that life handed us. Un(fortunately?) our adoptive parents sent my sister to Utah after they broke her, something inside her just snapped and she just pretty much was crazy after that. Me, they kept up appearances and changed from physical abuse to mental and gaslighting, making me think I was crazy as a kind of game to them. They thought it was funny how I would doubt myself and get scared I was messed up, and I deserved what they did to us.

Well, we usually 'conscript' the medical students to help out during maggot removal, so I was conscripted into this kind of service during med school. Most people probably dont realise, but when you would begin the procedure, you are in full surgical scrubs, with gloves, mask, glasses, everything, so there's quite a barrier between you and the whole ordeal.newLineCharnewLineCharIf you do it alone, it's kinda peaceful actually. It's a slow, time consuming work, to pinch every single maggot out (there are hundreds sometimes).

You may be laughing your ass off, but i'm dead serious: a marathon where donations go straight into the pockets of the runners and staff for entertaining us.

No more flying creatures, no outskirts. Monster movement is much simpler (some people may think that this takes away from the combat, but in my opinion it just minimizes upkeep). There's also no upkeep phase dedicated to changing your stats (in Arkham, you had to change your stats every round with the sliders), which I preferred and made the game go by at more brisk pace.newLineCharnewLineCharThe core mechanics are still the same - closing gates is still a big part of the game, but closing gates actually does not contribute *directly* to winning the game in Eldritch. Instead, you win the game by solving mysteries, which are different for each Ancient One. Of course, closing the gates will give you more time to solve the mysteries, and some mysteries will require that you close gates.newLineCharnewLineCharThat said, I will have to say that the Foresaken Lore expansion is practically necessary for Eldritch as the Core Set does not contain that many encounter cards - one of my only grifes with the core set.

Where my words wouldn't suffice, I turn to Urban Dictionary: newLineCharnewLineChar'The act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone the subject is dating, but no longer wishes to date. This is done in hopes that the ghostee will just 'get the hint' and leave the subject alone, as opposed to the subject simply telling them he/she is no longer interested. Ghosting is not specific to a certain gender and is closely related to the subject's maturity and communication skills. Many attempt to justify ghosting as a way to cease dating the ghostee without hurting their feelings, but it in fact proves the subject is thinking more of themselves, as ghosting often creates more confusion for the ghostee than if the subject kindly stated how he/she feels.'

Okay so he had the 4 of hearts already 'imprinted' on his chest before the trick started.. My first thought is, he must have had all 5 of those cards 'imprinted' on his body somewhere so he can succeed with the trick.. But then the question is how did he force him to choose those 5 cards?  It's possible he did a fake shuffle at the beginning, but that still doesn't explain the kid getting those cards *after* the kid cut the deck.  My brother has been into magic for decades and I can usually figure out 99% of tricks but this one is stumping me...newLineCharnewLineCharEdit*  It's possible that prior to the trick he stacked the deck such that there is only a total of 10 different cards in the deck.  At the beginning he 'Fake shuffles' such that the cards aren't mixed up.. when the kid cuts the deck, he has a super low chance of drawing five cards such that one is repeated.  He tells him to choose a non obvious one (the lower cards are probably in more 'awesome' locations when he reveals them) and then he goes from there?  He obviously doesn't know what the kid chooses since he asks him to reveal it.. Just a theory but damn I want to figure that one out..newLineCharnewLineCharEdit2*  He also tells the kid to spread the cards, and 'Don't touch them' so maybe the cards are marked on the back and he knows which cards the kid is looking at?  Hrmm

It looks like most of the pieces are custom. Definitely the paint, hood, the knee pads, and the filter.  The guns are probably from [BrickArms]( http://www.brickarms.com/). I'm not sure  if the nvgs, the backpack, and the chest rig are custom or just modified Lego pieces.

But there isn't some ethereal tank of energy everyone has, and you constantly are trying to pinpoint how frequently or intensely you can train. Although you're taking some pretty solid license on explaining how competitive lifters on gear train, I think you're missing the point. newLineCharnewLineCharYou know how hard you can train after a while, period. There are fluctuations, but it isn't as if some days you can do twice the volume and other days you can do nothing. It's a much smoother progression than that.newLineCharnewLineCharEdit: AAS also doesn't mean that suddenly you're a genius or the best trained athlete in the world. I see plenty of people at the gym who work biceps every day. They aren't on juice, neither am I, and I'd never do that. Training is intensely personal when it comes down to it, because everyone responds differently to the host of stimuli lifting offers. AAS doesn't mean you can train 10 times a day and never get hurt, or that suddenly you're going to lift intelligently if you've been lifting like a donkey up to that point.

I think it boils down to marketing. Five Pawns focuses on exclusivity (custom flavorings, price point, emphasis on 'lifestyle marketing') and, let's be honest, gimmicks (barrel aging, coffee bean in the bottle, 'golden ticket' contest).newLineCharnewLineCharUsing a mostly exclusive base ingredient ticks both of those boxes; it bolsters the you-can't-get-this-anywhere-else image and hooks the consumer in with something novel.newLineCharnewLineCharI'm very curious how it will go over. Five Pawns has been on the decline. They're too expensive compared to other equally high-quality juice and consumers are getting savvy. Black Flag Fallen was a commercial flop. They're killing two of their flavors (Absolute Pin and Sixty Four, which they're supposed to replace with new flavors near the end of this year). They certainly have a 'way' of doing things, and will always have a niche in the market, but I'm not sure it will grow, and may likely shrink.

Sounds like your mom did a number on your self-esteem; possibly so that you'd always rely solely on her for love.  However, an internet stranger is not going to change how you feel about yourself by telling you you're probably prettier than you think (which is likely, but I digress).  newLineCharnewLineCharLet's say for the sake of the argument you're right and that you're not particularly attractive - there are a lot of folks out there considered 'ugly' but societal standards.  Many are married or are in relationships none the less (or have been at one time).  newLineCharnewLineCharI recommend that you join clubs, a running group, sports, committees or volunteer in your community, with the goal of meeting people.  (I suggest physical activity not because you may or may not be 'Rubenesque' but because exercise improves depression/mood.  I make this distinction in the event that being called fat is a trigger for you). newLineCharnewLineCharMake friends.  Friends can give love and curb loneliness and can give you not only a boost of self esteem but also they can help you evaluate reality from a perspective that's not your mom's.  They can introduce you to others and be a support system.  Attractiveness is heavily reliant on confidence; build yourself up.  Even if you never find the right person, it's never a waste of time to do self-care or to work on self-improvement.  Good luck, from one 'ugly duckling' to another.  :)   newLineChar

It wasn't just about the ring it was about bringing the kingdoms of Man back to functioning levels. Sauron's corruption was deep and that wouldn't just disappear even if the ring melted. Gandalf set out to restore the thrones of Rohan and Gondor and purge them of their foul presence. He managed to kill a balrog as well.

You're willfully missing the point. No matter what he'd done he did not deserve to be executed and that's exactly what the cops did to him. Even under the most charitable, authority - worshipping explanation, they still killed him through negligence by putting him in a situation where he was injured and not providing timely medical aid. That's not ok ; when a cop arrests you they are legally liable for your continued good health. It is their barest minimum responsibility to keep you alive, for Christ's sake! People would rightly be pissed even if this was some sort of bizarre accident because being arrested means you're supposed to kept alive. As it is, the cops have a long history of killing people in transport and no one believes this is an accident at all. They're just floating this shit to muddy the waters and get the right-wing cop-suckers to say with a straight face 'yeah, he broke his own neck to make the cops look bad'.

Specifically we're talking about the [Google Mobile Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Mobile_Services) apps here.  For the most part not an issue for most apps, but occasionally they will be used by things (especially Google Maps), but I can see Microsoft building replacements that they can make available on Android and Windows to mitigate the issue if it becomes one.  Furthermore, in the announcement they said that there would be some APIs that weren't available on Windows, though we don't know yet what those will be. 
Implying there is a difference between their characterization at this point.

I'd take Flowers over Peat.  He's drafted to be a RT initially and he is a physical mauler right now.  Beatty isn't a bad LT.  Stick him at RT, kick Pugh down RG, and all the sudden the O-line looks not half bad when Shwartz is healthy

two forces that sometimes are enough on their own, sometimes work together: 1. Colleges don't like failing people. It can wreck their GPA, which makes them less hire-able (sometimes) or, worse, it can make them take longer to graduate. So oftentimes it's difficult to fail. 2. Professors like rewarding effort. So if someone works REALLY hard, does a TON of extra credit work, sees you in your office hours, etc etc, the professor is more likely to pass them.

He ran as an independent in both his House and Senate campaigns, but to be a presidential candidate he does not have that option.  You can't get ballot access in enough states to win unless you get the nomination of a party that has that ballot access.*  The only other parties that have enough states to win are the Republicans and the Libertarians.  There is also the issue of getting into debates.  Third parties are effectively blacked out because they need to reach a threshold (12% if memory serves) of support in the polls.  While I think it is probably an obtainable number for him most of the polls only list the donkeys and elephants so he wouldn't be able to rank in them at all.newLineCharnewLineCharnewLineChar*It's not literally impossible to get ballot access as an independent it's just completely unrealistic.newLineChar

Sure thing. You could always get a job in a factory and see how much lateral movement (at best) that affords you... Law isn't what it used to be, no one is saying that it is, but it *does* have versatility. You can say it doesn't and read US News reports about this and that but the fact remains that it's a job with incredible freedom. If you can't get a job - you can work for yourself. If you don't like the type of law you're doing, you can do another. If you don't like law at all, you can do something nonlegal. Will it necessarily be super lucrative? No. But what realistic guarantees are there in life ever? We're not doctors - we don't make a killing just for going to school for a long time. Forge your own path.

My understanding (from some googling I did many, many months ago) is that there was an issue with iOS where 2x, 2.5x and 3x all played at double speed due to some sort of limitation. And so they decided that rather than change hte titles they would keep 3x as the top speed, being double speed, and then scale back the other ones. Although it was an iOS issue it appears that they keep the speed matched across iOS and Android (I recently made the swap, so have experience with both)newLineCharnewLineCharI have noticed that on iOS the downpur app plays 3x at triple speed, so maybe hte iOS issue is gone but Audible has stuck with their system as everyone is used to it.newLineCharnewLineChar1x is definintely not slowed down. If you play it and time it 1 minutes of audio takes 1 minute of playback. Do you normally go with 1.5x speed? If so, then it will become normalised to you and anything else feels slow.

Or how about the time where competing in the class for highest mark for the entire class for the entire year. My reward was 1 day off that I didn't have to go to class. I took nice advantage of that. Next day I go in during the usual time. School was practically empty. I went to the office to find out what was going on. They told the classes they needed to come to school early the day I was off. They were doing some end of the year field trip that I was unaware of. It was to the school's affiliated catholic church not far away but the whole school went. newLineCharnewLineCharMy punishment for being late to school that day was that I had bags and I was to de-weed the school's grounds. Starting with the front and then going to the fields. I pretty much spent the entire day pulling weeds. newLineCharnewLineCharThe school also got locked so I wasn't able to go in to get my food or even water fountain. Oh and my lunch and bag disappeared. I had put it on my hook like usual and someone took it thinking it was a forgotten or it was stolen. Closer to 2pm when they got back to the school and they realized what happened to me. They apologized to me which was practically the only apology I ever got when I was at that school.

Reference cards intake air from the fan and exhaust through the back, outside of the case. So your notion is correct.newLineCharnewLineCharWhat OP means is that most aftermarket/non-reference designs simply vent the hot air all around the card and into the case, since they do not always have a shroud to direct the airflow outside the case. This can be compensated in different ways, so I'd say it has a negligible effect.

Are you considering the bond when saying that? The card is equivalent to an undiolized SR with ~5000 cool and an idolized with ~4750 cool, depending on the stats when you consider the bond in there. newLineCharnewLineCharI'm against the card because the card is blatantly sexualized, and I am completely against the designers doing that.

It's actually a relevant distinction. Social democrats are capitalists. Socialists are anti-capitalist. For leftists, economic systems are central to *everything*. That's the huge thing about Marxism, it recognises the decoupling of history from the economic circumstances of the people living it (and instead postulating great people and great events) as false. *Within* various leftist communities, the Monty Python quote is apt. Regarding social democracy and democratic socialism it isn't.

Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore—all represented by black mayors by the way—are all disciplined by bond rating agencies and by experts, who make life and death funding decisions based on their ability to govern themselves according to technologies of subjectivity. Finally, we can easily imagine a family governed by all three sets of techniques—an HIV+father who attends a prosperity gospel church along with his school-aged son not only attempts to use these techniques to make healthy choices (to develop a rigorous HIV testing regiment for example), but attends a local church using the pastor's sermons to get his financial house in order, while his son competes with other kids for cash prizes. Caught in overlapping frameworks of governance, this father and child can potentially understand their lives as being determined by political circumstances they are not responsible for. But it is far more likely they will fault themselves (and each other) for their condition. And as these modes of government play an increasing role in our lives, it is far more likely we will as well.'

I still dream about Cassel's back being healthy.  It was a good, closer WCF between the Lakers and Wolves without him, and he was a huge part of the team's success that year.newLineCharnewLineCharEven with the injury, he gutted through 64 minutes and scored 37 points in 4 games.  Poor Darrick Martin had to start and play big minutes in his place, and he was just overwhelmed.  Shot 29% from the series.newLineCharnewLineCharThe 4 Laker wins were by 11, 9, 7, and 6 points.  If Cassel's healthy, that series goes 7, with Game 7 at the Target Center.  Would've been an all-timer, and a real chance for Prime Kevin Garnet to be nationally showcased.newLineCharnewLineCharShaq was a dominator, Duncan was greatness you could set your watch by, but Prime KG was a basketball force.  He affected every facet of the game at 7'1'.  Makes me sad that people's image of him seems to be during his Celtic years.  He was still great, but he was 31 and in his 12th year when he joined them, not to mention injuries had already started eating away at him.newLineCharnewLineCharMakes me sad thinking about it still.

I DO think it would be cool if they found a way to work in that comparison subtly, but I dunno if I want him to go THAT dark. One of my favorite things about the MCU is the long game they've been playing, with Tony slowly changing into the man who can fit the mold of the Tony from Civil War. But if he's the clear cut bad guy of the movie, that will be a massive failure. I want him to get darker, sure, and I think he has, but I also want to understand why he does the things that he does and to find his reasoning at least a little convincing. newLineCharnewLineCharCivil War won't work if I don't believe both sides. Of course, we don't know what shape the conflict is going to take, either, or even how big the hero vs. hero aspect of it's going to be. We obviously don't know much of anything concrete about that movie, so speculation at this point's kinda baseless. I just really really like what they've done with Tony in Phase 2, and I wanna see them stick the landing.

No clue about the cover for any of those places, I'm not a fight fan but I work in the business so I gotta know who's showing it. They were trying to charge my restaurant 6k to show it. We already barely break even on a 4k UFC fight, it just isn't worth showing to be honest. I will tell you from all the calls I've been getting about it, you will be better off having some friends come over and chip on it, you'll save a fuck ton of money. The few places showing it are going to be PACKED, and will probably have a hefty cover.

We're talking about NorthWest Majors, the only post-release major tournament to happen so far, which was Quan Chi vs Kung Jin.newLineCharnewLineCharIncredible set might I add. You should look it up. But you can definitely see where the Kung Jin complaints come when watching it. I believe it was Wonder_Chef on Quan Chi, who pretty much had to be on point the entire time, or risk eating an almost 50% combo. He had to guess right what felt like 10+ times, where was Kung Jin only needed to guess right twice, which would not be so bad had it not been for all his armor and safe strings.

If you were to look at it as a simple equation of price divided by number of pieces, then yes. However for match rounds, I keep my lots separated through the life of the brass. Since Nosler brass comes in packs of 50, I have 10 five round groups per box. It would cost me $1.20 to use one of my pieces, however that would leave me with 9 five round groups and 1 four round groups. It is worth more than $1.20 to not do that.

If you watch her Chinese music video Oh-oh, either in Mandarin or English, the make-up is making her asian side, specifically her eyes, come out more. I mostly have trouble with believing Jaying being the mother because of the age, and the fact that the actor, sadly, doesn't play it as 'old and wise', at least not as how I see it.

I guess I don't *necessarily* disagree, but it would require a significant modification in social norms that are prevalent across most human cultures... I'm pretty sure in most of the world being completely nude is generally frowned upon in public places.newLineCharnewLineCharI do believe that breasts (for example) can be desexualized as there are many cultures that do not do so, but nakedness itself is seen near universally as a very personal thing, something that you would only express to another who you deeply cared for romantically. At the same time, sexuality is also driven by basic physical urges which I feel creates a situation incompatible with the intellectual notion of decoupling sex and nudity.

At the very least, [according to Indiana University](http://www.iub.edu/~vpgc/docs/Compliance/HIPAA-G02_HIPAA_Guidance_Safeguarding_Patients_Photographs_Recordings.pdf) this would violate their HIPAA guidelines, provided that the patient didn't consent and those are personal recording devices.  The only photographs that seem to be excluded are those of samples themselves (like a slide of a tissue sample or, I guess, just the dildo).  Most hospitals have similar guidelines, and teaching hospitals in general are pretty paranoid about having anything unauthorized end up online.

Headaches are relieved by constricting blood vessels and reducing pressure. Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor. Not sure why I get down voted for stating a medical fact. Caffeine works by attaching itself to adenosine, constricting blood vessels, and increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the brain. Alcohol, on the other hand, is a vasodilator, you'll notice flushing and redness, as well as headaches, often result from alcohol consumption.

You hold a teaspoon of zinc sulfate solution in your mouth for about 10 seconds. If there's an immediate taste perception, you're probably not deficient.

Sure. newLineCharnewLineCharThe pro legalization people make some sound arguments, but they discount a lot of things as well. newLineCharnewLineChar- marijuana is a price sensitive drug for young people, basic rule of supply and demand (and some other factors) says that more supply = lower price. By keeping the price high, less kids will have money to buy it. To give an extreme example, if 1 gram of marijuana cost $500,000 no kid would ever smoke weed again. newLineCharnewLineChar- community standards, a lot of people don't want marijuana legalized they don't want to be around it. Let's be honest about marijuana it stinks! It has a more powerful smell than cigarettes. Sure there are edibles (I'll get to those later!) but you can be smoking weed in the house next door and I can smell it. newLineCharnewLineChar- edibles are just dangerous. There is no labelling, one could easily give one to a child by accident (which has happened many times and increased instances in Colorado since legalization) leading to hospital visits. One could eat a brownie not knowing it has reefer and go and drive.newLineCharnewLineChar- long term, I am not sure if there is money to be made. Did you know we lose money from tobacco and alcohol legalization? All the societal costs including (but not limited to) medical bills, enforcement, health/safety codes, missed work, DUI ect.

Maybe, but I don't think it is that short. Mason looked good against bad teams and good teams crushed him. I know the Rams had offensive line struggles, but clearly they think Gurley is a beast.  I didn't expect this pick, but I get it. I don't think the leash is short, he would have to play really bad for him to lose significant playing time. I feel like Rams fans over inflate our RB talent. Stacy carried too much extra weight, Cunningham is a 3rd down pass catcher, and Mason, who I like, might not be able to be as physical for a long period of time. newLineCharnewLineCharThe 2 linemen they wanted were off the board, Parker didn't make sense, there was no defensive linemen that were highly regarded and Waynes would be dumb. The Rams could maybe use a safety/corner, but Waynes to me will not be that much of an upgrade. They took best player available and if he stays healthy he should be good with the Rams. newLineCharnewLineCharBoom or bust pick to me. At #10 I expect a great RB or just another RB that we don't need.

Fair point, I fully agree that giving advice to women might have more direct cause and effect as far as reducing the short-term incidence of rape.newLineCharnewLineCharBut as I said above, the public conversation is always about women needing to change their behaviour, which has the unintended consequence of ingraining in people's minds that the women are to blame and men are just gonna keep on raping because that's what they do.newLineCharnewLineCharMaybe if the public conversation contained a little more condemnation of the rapists and the horrific effects of their actions, it would contribute to a long-term shift in culture that reduces rape in the long run.

Not siding with the guy you're talking with and his views on this problem, but the problem with changing an ecosystem this extensively is that we don't know HOW  it will change and how those changes could harm us.newLineCharnewLineCharYou're right that it's silly to believe every species will survive, but it's silly to think our species will weather any ecological change. Something like this could easily harm Brazil in the long term with anything from increased insect populations spreading disease, to the changes in the rainforest causing declines in tourism and the huge amount of money they get from that, to wars that arise as the changes they instill in their territories end up affecting other countries.newLineCharnewLineCharMessing with the environment on this scale simply carries risks we can't predict.

I'm not going to dispense relationship advice as any asshole can give advice; I prefer to give experiences. newLineCharnewLineCharMy ex is Russian and saw a lot of tragic shit over there to the point she was numb, like me from being overseas, to pretty much anything other than child &amp; animal abuse. She moved to MN in 2001 and I figured she was immune to damn near everything as wekkand then she saw a car accident up near Fargo where a woman died. I briefly asked about it and she shrugged it off like it was nothing; so naturally I left it there. Weeks later she started having nightmares about it because it kicked into high gear a ton of things she had repressed when she left Russia. So in my experience you don't need to constantly bombard her about it as she is likely in shock right now, but ask her before the night is over if she wants to talk about it or if she would like you be there for her.newLineCharnewLineCharIts the right thing and she will appreciate it no matter what you might think right now and its a genuinely caring thing to do for her.newLineCharnewLineCharAgain, best thoughts to the both of you and let me know if I can help at all as I have a lot of experience, personally and professionally (I worked in the field).newLineCharnewLineCharIf you need a get away this weekend I am hosting a MN meet up for /r/cigars and /r/centuryclub - feel free to reach out and pop over.newLineCharnewLineCharhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/33fcks/the_bums_first_2015_mn_rcigars_herf_a_celebration/

Dave's all about the ridiculous monologues though. When I first read Homestuck back in 2011, I looked up to him because he could turn a phrase like no one's fucking business. Seinfeld could take a lesson from Dave in talking about something with so many meaningless words surrounding it.newLineCharnewLineCharLike, it's not written with an eye-bleeding quirk like Kankri's, and it's done casually and helps get John up to speed, and it's something that's clearly important to Dave.

I just really like that I can be an active part of the development of a (soon to be even more) awesome app that will be a part of many people's daily lives in the future. Plus, the beta gives me a nice distraction from my schoolwork (in a good way!)

I'm a senior. I made a gun. The tutorial I watched was mostly helpful, but the guy kept making mistakes and it ended up being 13 videos long. Of course I didn't need to have the most details since I was putting it in my game. I haven't made anything else yet, but I may make a few more easy things like barriers. Just know that it takes a long time to do details and make sure everything is symmetrical or whatever. The gun I made is probably way easier than any kind of art you would be wanting to do. So good luck. Just keep trying.

I should clarify that it's not my opinion.newLineCharnewLineCharThe link I provided does mention it why some people believe it though:newLineCharnewLineChar&gt; Those who oppose the drinking of alcohol, in any quantity, argue that Jesus would not have turned the water into wine, as He would have been promoting the consumption of a substance that is tainted by sin. In this understanding, alcohol itself is inherently sinful, and consumption of alcohol in any quantity is sin. That is not a biblical understanding, however. Some Scriptures discuss alcohol in positive terms. Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from your own vineyard as a sign of God’s blessing. Isaiah 55:1 encourages, “Yes, come buy wine and milk…” From these and other Scriptures, it is clear that alcohol itself is not inherently sinful. Rather, it is the abuse of alcohol, drunkenness and/or addiction, that is sinful (Ephesians 5:18; Proverbs 23:29-35; 1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19). Therefore, it would not have been a sin for Jesus to create a drink that contained alcohol.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt; A second, related argument is that by creating alcoholic wine, Jesus would have been promoting drunkenness, which the Bible clearly identifies as sinful. This is not a valid argument. Was Jesus promoting gluttony when He multiplied the fishes and loaves far beyond what the people needed? Of course not. Creating a substance that can be abused does not make one responsible when another person foolishly chooses to abuse it. Jesus creating alcoholic wine was in no sense encouraging drunkenness.newLineChar

I have no idea what your calorie intake is, or what your exercise program is, as what you've outlined seems very vague. Eating above maintenance is going to cause you to gain muscle as well as body fat.

Bernie [on TPP](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file):newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disastrous trade agreement designed to protect the interests of the largestnewLineCharmulti-national corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations ofnewLineCharAmerican democracy.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;It is part of a global race to the bottom tonewLineCharboost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights;newLineChardismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challengenewLineCharour laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system.newLineCharnewLineCharTo see how TPP is actually beneficial, look at what MIT labor economist Autor said in the article I posted e.g.:newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;There are several reasons to support the TPP despite globalization concerns. First, the TPP — which seeks to govern exchange of not only traditional goods and services, but also intellectual property and foreign investment — would promote trade in knowledge-intensive services in which U.S. companies exert a strong comparative advantage. Second, killing the TPP would do little to bring factory work back to America. Third, and perhaps most important, although China is not part of the TPP, enacting the agreement would raise regulatory rules and standards for several of China’s key trading partners. That would pressure China to meet some of those standards and cease its attempts to game global trade to impede foreign multinational companies.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;Most notably, it promises to liberalize trade in services and in agriculture, sectors in which the United States runs large trade surpluses, but which the World Trade Organization, despite 20 years of trying, has failed to pry open internationally. Successfully exporting information and computer services, where the U.S. maintains substantial technological leadership, requires more than low tariffs. It also requires protecting patents against infringement and safeguarding business assets and revenues against expropriation by foreign governments. newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;If passed, the TPP also would create a powerful template for future trade deals, including with China, which would move the U.S. closer to resolving conflicts the WTO has been unable to handle. Consider, for example, the case of Qualcomm, a highly successful San Diego-based maker of chipsets for wireless communications that earns half of its global revenues in China. The company’s substantial share of the Chinese chip market attracted the attention of the Chinese government, which proceeded to extract $1 billion in fines for alleged anti-competitive practices. In the U.S., where Qualcomm also sells its chipsets, the company has faced no such anti-trust penalties.newLineCharnewLineChar&gt;Under current trade law, Qualcomm has little recourse to appeal its treatment by the Chinese government. Under a trade agreement with China like the TPP, however, Qualcomm and other U.S. companies would have access to an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism.newLineCharnewLineCharHere Bernie talks to former Fed Chair Bernanke [about Fed lending](https://youtu.be/oOpQkRsEfaU?t=1m37s). As Bernanke said, they were only legally allowed to lend directly to depository institutions. Bernie also wanted to know why the Fed was not disclosing who they were lending to. There were two reasons, one that Bernanke brought up - institutions were reluctant to go to the Fed because it looks bad to debt markets (like they're insolvent). And what he didn't say is that the Fed was worried about triggering money market runs (if the lenders thought those institutions were insolvent). newLineCharnewLineCharIn [Ten Fair Ways to Reduce the Deficit and Create Jobs](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top10), Bernie lists currency manipulation by China and others as something which tackling would be beneficial. With TPP and other trade deals being discussed, currency manipulation was brought back on the table [by Bernie and others](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/Stop-Currency-Manipulation-New-Battle-Cry-Democrats).newLineCharnewLineCharAs I said, no real proof is available to support that China has been manipulating exchange rates because of how the currencies are moving in forex markets. I can't think of major currency manipulators right now. But I'd curious how Bernie planned on differentiating between all types of currency intervention, like soft pegs and managed floats, from currency manipulation.

It's different than the rest of the series in the way it's directed and in a lot of ways it best represents the world of Harry Potter, with the effects and the magic. Cuaron had a lot to with that in his direction and the score is probably my favorite of the series as well. It's also Michael Gambon's first turn as Dumbledore and it's a bit more subtle, and the first movie with Lupin and Sirius Black. Azkaban is by far my favorite of the series.

Oh come on, let's not allow a video making fun of the fight, when slowed down frame by frame and analyzed to death as a joke, interfere with the fact that it looks like a fast paced, amazing action sequence as it was supposed to be viewed in the context of the film. I can take a million fight scenes from movies and show you how they don't actually swing at an opponents face every single time, the idea is that it looks plausible when watching the movie. Action sequences do not have to look perfect when held up to slow motion scrutiny, that's absurd. newLineCharnewLineCharIn anticipation of 'I noticed the first time I saw it!' hey, can't argue with that statement, I can just tell you that before I noticed people analyzing the shit out of an action sequence because they have a hard on for hating these movies (which is fine, they suck in a lot of ways), these sequences always looked great. We do not need a typical sword fight, lightsabers are one of the most unique and cool weapons in science fiction history, having the fights look like they're being fought by absolute lightening quick professionals who know their craft is great.newLineCharnewLineCharHow many action movies can you slow down or rewind over and over to see henchmen dancing in the background, or punches that would not have connected with anything had they not been blocked? It's just a movie...

Female rangers are quite stylish indeed, but do keep in mind that we are missing a large amount of features when compared to this video since we are several patches behind. Currently the female ranger has a rather confusing system (others might find it not as confusing but it is weird for me) where a class defining chain blade buff stops you from using some of your shooting skills and restricts you to only using modified kicks, which are pretty cool and are definitely viable but having half your skills locked away from you might be kinda weird. In the future her twin chainblades ability gets worked into a passive into her kit which allows her to use all her skills. I would wait until then.

Of course, closing the gates will give you more time to solve the mysteries, and some mysteries will require that you close gates.newLineCharnewLineCharThat said, I will have to say that the Foresaken Lore expansion is practically necessary for Eldritch as the Core Set does not contain that many encounter cards - one of my only grifes with the core set.

Where my words wouldn't suffice, I turn to Urban Dictionary: newLineCharnewLineChar'The act of suddenly ceasing all communication with someone the subject is dating, but no longer wishes to date. This is done in hopes that the ghostee will just 'get the hint' and leave the subject alone, as opposed to the subject simply telling them he/she is no longer interested. Ghosting is not specific to a certain gender and is closely related to the subject's maturity and communication skills. Many attempt to justify ghosting as a way to cease dating the ghostee without hurting their feelings, but it in fact proves the subject is thinking more of themselves, as ghosting often creates more confusion for the ghostee than if the subject kindly stated how he/she feels.'

Okay so he had the 4 of hearts already 'imprinted' on his chest before the trick started.. My first thought is, he must have had all 5 of those cards 'imprinted' on his body somewhere so he can succeed with the trick.. But then the question is how did he force him to choose those 5 cards?  It's possible he did a fake shuffle at the beginning, but that still doesn't explain the kid getting those cards *after* the kid cut the deck.  My brother has been into magic for decades and I can usually figure out 99% of tricks but this one is stumping me...newLineCharnewLineCharEdit*  It's possible that prior to the trick he stacked the deck such that there is only a total of 10 different cards in the deck.  At the beginning he 'Fake shuffles' such that the cards aren't mixed up.. when the kid cuts the deck, he has a super low chance of drawing five cards such that one is repeated.  He tells him to choose a non obvious one (the lower cards are probably in more 'awesome' locations when he reveals them) and then he goes from there?  He obviously doesn't know what the kid chooses since he asks him to reveal it.. Just a theory but damn I want to figure that one out..newLineCharnewLineCharEdit2*  He also tells the kid to spread the cards, and 'Don't touch them' so maybe the cards are marked on the back and he knows which cards the kid is looking at?  Hrmm

But there isn't some ethereal tank of energy everyone has, and you constantly are trying to pinpoint how frequently or intensely you can train. Although you're taking some pretty solid license on explaining how competitive lifters on gear train, I think you're missing the point. newLineCharnewLineCharYou know how hard you can train after a while, period. There are fluctuations, but it isn't as if some days you can do twice the volume and other days you can do nothing.

I see plenty of people at the gym who work biceps every day. They aren't on juice, neither am I, and I'd never do that. Training is intensely personal when it comes down to it, because everyone responds differently to the host of stimuli lifting offers. AAS doesn't mean you can train 10 times a day and never get hurt, or that suddenly you're going to lift intelligently if you've been lifting like a donkey up to that point.

I think it boils down to marketing. Five Pawns focuses on exclusivity (custom flavorings, price point, emphasis on 'lifestyle marketing') and, let's be honest, gimmicks (barrel aging, coffee bean in the bottle, 'golden ticket' contest).newLineCharnewLineCharUsing a mostly exclusive base ingredient ticks both of those boxes; it bolsters the you-can't-get-this-anywhere-else image and hooks the consumer in with something novel.newLineCharnewLineCharI'm very curious how it will go over. Five Pawns has been on the decline. They're too expensive compared to other equally high-quality juice and consumers are getting savvy. Black Flag Fallen was a commercial flop. They're killing two of their flavors (Absolute Pin and Sixty Four, which they're supposed to replace with new flavors near the end of this year). They certainly have a 'way' of doing things, and will always have a niche in the market, but I'm not sure it will grow, and may likely shrink.

Sounds like your mom did a number on your self-esteem; possibly so that you'd always rely solely on her for love.  However, an internet stranger is not going to change how you feel about yourself by telling you you're probably prettier than you think (which is likely, but I digress).  newLineCharnewLineCharLet's say for the sake of the argument you're right and that you're not particularly attractive - there are a lot of folks out there considered 'ugly' but societal standards.  Many are married or are in relationships none the less (or have been at one time).  newLineCharnewLineCharI recommend that you join clubs, a running group, sports, committees or volunteer in your community, with the goal of meeting people.  (I suggest physical activity not because you may or may not be 'Rubenesque' but because exercise improves depression/mood.  I make this distinction in the event that being called fat is a trigger for you). newLineCharnewLineCharMake friends.  Friends can give love and curb loneliness and can give you not only a boost of self esteem but also they can help you evaluate reality from a perspective that's not your mom's.  They can introduce you to others and be a support system.  Attractiveness is heavily reliant on confidence; build yourself up.  Even if you never find the right person, it's never a waste of time to do self-care or to work on self-improvement.  Good luck, from one 'ugly duckling' to another.  :)   newLineChar

Completly agreed. It is nice that we both have young teams so our players form more of a rivalry with each other the older they get. I hope we can play a NFC championship game against each other sometime soon!
I'll let you know.  I should have it built sometime Sunday and sitting next to the x-wing.

No trade clause plus a player option after this year... I may be in the minority but I fully believe anything short of 10 wins and Mack walks.  Have you seen our schedule? He's as good as gone. Hopefully he helps this guy learn and leaves Cam in a great spot to take over at center next season.

And God bless them for it. The random extra that was also in the trailer was rocking some bounce too.
You're willfully missing the point. No matter what he'd done he did not deserve to be executed and that's exactly what the cops did to him. Even under the most charitable, authority - worshipping explanation, they still killed him through negligence by putting him in a situation where he was injured and not providing timely medical aid. That's not ok ; when a cop arrests you they are legally liable for your continued good health. It is their barest minimum responsibility to keep you alive, for Christ's sake! People would rightly be pissed even if this was some sort of bizarre accident because being arrested means you're supposed to kept alive. As it is, the cops have a long history of killing people in transport and no one believes this is an accident at all. They're just floating this shit to muddy the waters and get the right-wing cop-suckers to say with a straight face 'yeah, he broke his own neck to make the cops look bad'. 
Oh yeah for sure, thats why I headed that way lol, tactical retreat.

Specifically we're talking about the [Google Mobile Services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Mobile_Services) apps here.  For the most part not an issue for most apps, but occasionally they will be used by things (especially Google Maps), but I can see Microsoft building replacements that they can make available on Android and Windows to mitigate the issue if it becomes one.  Furthermore, in the announcement they said that there would be some APIs that weren't available on Windows, though we don't know yet what those will be. 
Implying there is a difference between their characterization at this point.
Every time I see an Su-34 pic all I can think of are the debriefs of F-111 pilots and EF-111 pilots talking about how they 'couldn't see shit' out of the right side of the cockpit while they were trying to fly evasive against an opposing aircraft. 
Unless you are muttering to yourself under your breath, I can pretty much guarantee that not only are people not interested in what you are doing, but they are likely actively trying to ignore everyone around them.  If where you live is anything like Toronto, anyway.  Ultimately,  you will leave the bus in a few minutes and never see the people there again.  That is an ideal situation for you, especially if you are nervous.  newLineCharnewLineCharCurious though, what is it about forcing on a bus that makes you think that people are taking note, and how would it be any different than any of the other thousands of people that close their eyes on transit every day?  Is this a genuine issue, or is it more a matter of anxiety and how you perceive yourself?  (That isn't dismissing anxiety, just wondering how difficult you would find it to change your mindset.)newLineCharnewLineChar

That's going to be the same problem either way, isn't it? If the main window fills both screens, they can open six individual spreadsheets inside it and size/move them as required. Gives the same result as six main windows on two screens. And the one main, six little windows has the advantage that the little windows don't have the menu/ribbon on them, IIRC, so they take up less space.
